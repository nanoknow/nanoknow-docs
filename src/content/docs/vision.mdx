In the United States alone, more than 165 shared nanofabrication facilities — spanning universities, national labs, and government research centers — support thousands of researchers every year. Around the world, hundreds more laboratories contribute to this collective expertise. Connecting these communities through shared knowledge will transform how discoveries are made, accelerating innovation across physics, chemistry, biology, mediocine, engineering, and beyond.
