# Getting Started with Nanofabrication

Welcome to the world of nanofabrication! This guide will walk you through the essential concepts and techniques you need to know when starting your journey in nanoscale manufacturing.

## What is Nanofabrication?

Nanofabrication is the design and manufacture of devices with dimensions measured in nanometers. One nanometer is one-billionth of a meter, or about 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair.

## Key Techniques

### 1. Photolithography

Photolithography is the foundation of modern nanofabrication. This process uses light to transfer patterns onto a substrate, enabling the creation of intricate nanoscale structures.

### 2. Electron Beam Lithography

For even finer features, electron beam lithography (EBL) offers superior resolution, capable of creating patterns at the sub-10nm scale.

### 3. Thin Film Deposition

Various deposition techniques allow us to build up layers of materials atom by atom:

- Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)
- Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)
- Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD)

## Safety Considerations

Working in a nanofabrication facility requires strict adherence to safety protocols:

- Always wear appropriate cleanroom garments
- Handle chemicals with proper PPE
- Follow contamination control procedures
- Understand equipment-specific safety guidelines

## Getting Started Checklist

1. Complete cleanroom training
2. Familiarize yourself with facility equipment
3. Review standard operating procedures
4. Start with simple processes before advancing
5. Document your work thoroughly
